## Overview
This repository contains the Python assignments for learning and practice by **Sukanta**. The goal is to build foundational skills in Python programming through hands-on tasks and examples.

## Features
- Task 1: Basic Python assignment.  
- Task 2: Additional Python scripts emphasising different programming constructs.  
- A workspace file for Visual Studio Code (`.code-workspace`) for organised editing.  
- A text resource file (`suk.txt`) with supplemental notes or data.  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MsSukanta/Sukanta_Learn_Py.git
````

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Sukanta_Learn_Py
   ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install any dependencies (if required). Note: At present, the scripts use standard Python libraries — no external packages needed.

## Usage

* Run the assignments by executing the corresponding `.py` files.

  ```bash
  python ASIGNMENT.PY  
  python TASK1.PY  
  python TASK2.py
  ```
* Open the `.code-workspace` file in VSCode to load the project set-up for easier editing.
* Inspect `suk.txt` for any supplementary notes or data used in the assignments.

Feel free to modify any of the sections — especially *Features*, *Usage*, and *Project Structure* — to better reflect your scripts and what they actually do.  
Would you like me to generate a more detailed README (e.g., describing each script’s functionality, adding badges, etc.)?
